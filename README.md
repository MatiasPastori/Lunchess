# Lunchess
First serverless approach project for an meal ordering system.

# Considerations

You are going to need a `vercel.json` and  `.env` files to configure some environment variables and some extra configs for this particular kind of projece since Vercel does support a NodeJS project with express to expose your API but it started to rely more on Next.JS... in any case, you are still capable of exposing an ExpressJS Standalone Project but you will need to keep these folder structure (altough you can still make some configurations in your Vercel dashboard) and you will need to make your vercel.json file and configure it yourself.
